# Wie Is Het?

To be able to run the game, some packages are required. These packages are as follows:

- ```pyglet```
- ```os```
- ```random```
- ```math```
- ```pillow```

Install these packages (if you do not have them installed yet) one by one by running the following command in your terminal:

```pip3 install <package name>```



Then, run the game by typing ```python3 main.py```

All images should be the same size, and put into folders in the Group folder. For each pack of images (a group of people) use one folder. Then you can mix and groups as you would like.
