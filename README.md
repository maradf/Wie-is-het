# Wie Is Het?

To be able to run the game, some packages are required. These packages are as follows:

- ```pyglet```
- ```os```
- ```random```
- ```math```
- ```pillow```

Install these packages (if you do not have them installed yet) one by one by running the following command in your terminal:

```pip3 install <package name>```



Then, run the game by typing ```python3 main.py``` in the terminal.

All images should be the same size, and put into subfolders in the "Groups/" folder. For each pack of images (a group of people) use one folder. Then you can mix and groups as you would like.
